## üåü Game Overview

Treasure Chest challenges players to navigate through three unique levels, each with its own set of obstacles and surprises:

- **Goal**: Reach the treasure chest to complete each level and advance to the next.
- **Challenges**: Each level introduces new obstacles such as traps, enemies, and other challenges.
- **Difficulty**: Levels become progressively more challenging.
- **Score**: Earn points based on performance in each level.

Players receive instructions at the start of each level, including hints on avoiding obstacles and tips for locating the treasure chest. The further they advance, the more intense and rewarding the journey becomes!

3. **Avoid Losing**: If you collide with obstacles or get caught by an enemy, the level restarts (but not the entire game).
4. **Advance to Next Level**: Once you find the chest, progress to the next, more challenging level.
5. **Score Points**: Earn points and compete for the highest score!
